This is a resubmission:  

In response to: 

    ########################### 
    Tnanks, I think your LICENSE file is not clear:

    I'd suggest to start with the BSD_3_clause template.
    Afterwards perhaps add a well recognizable separator (as other team 
    members have not udnerstood this is about an extra license) and say an 
    alternative license follows as in:


    =======================================
    ALTERNATIVE LICENSE INFORMATION FOLLOWS
    =======================================

    ###########################

I have added the template for the BSD3 clause license as well as the additional limited liability text which is required for software developed by the US National Institutes of Health, separated by the suggested separator: 

    =======================================
    ALTERNATIVE LICENSE INFORMATION FOLLOWS
    =======================================
    
    R package dsb... [remainder of additional license text]
