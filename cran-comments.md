    better, but then only the template part for BSD_3_clause, i.e. I'd porpose the following (while it is advisable to clearly state       the copyright holders):


    ================

    YEAR:2021
    COPYRIGHT HOLDER: NA
    ORGANIZATION: National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), a participating institute of the National Institutes      of Health (NIH)


    =======================================
    ALTERNATIVE LICENSE INFORMATION FOLLOWS
    =======================================

Thank you for your help. I have added the template part for the BSD3 clause with the alternative license information as suggested.
With respect to copyright, since we are public employees of the us government, the software is part of the public domain and it is not subject to copyright. For example, this is also the case for the popular software imageJ https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/disclaimer.html. 
That is stated in the alternative license text; I also stated this directly in the BSD-3 license template in the COPYRIGHT field.
